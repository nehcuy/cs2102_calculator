# CS2102 Calculator

## Self Initiated Project

I followed the given algorithms in CS2102 by using closures to make basic calculations with
given relations during my time taking CS2102. This project uses Java and possibly Python in
the near future to automate the process of calculating closures and finding candidate keys
of a set of attributes and relations.

Hope this helps reduce time wasted on finding
closures when number of attributes and relations increase. :)
